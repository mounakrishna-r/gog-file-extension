    Hello friends! Today we''re going to talk about something very important - global
    warming. It''s like when the Earth gets too hot because of all the things we do.
    Let''s learn more about it in a fun way!


    **What is Global Warming?**

    - Global warming is when the Earth''s temperature goes up because of things like
    pollution and cutting down trees.

    - It makes the Earth hotter, which can cause problems for animals and plants.


    **How Has Global Warming Changed Over the Years?**

    - In the past, the Earth was cooler and animals and plants were happier.

    - But now, because of what people are doing, the Earth is getting hotter and it''s
    not good for anyone.


    **What Can We Do to Help?**

    - We can plant trees to help cool down the Earth.

    - We can recycle our toys and use less plastic to reduce pollution.


    Remember, even though global warming is a big problem, we can all do our part
    to help make the Earth a better place for everyone. Let''s be kind to our planet
    and each other!'
